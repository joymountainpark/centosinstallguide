# yum install mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
--> this installs the mysql repository with MySQL and Workbench rpm packages (and others) - this probably you have installed and as a result of that, you do read this post...
--> the installation is like the local one from the rpm file - you can get it from the Oracle MySQL web at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/yum/ - get the rpm file for Red Hat Enetrprise Linux 7

# yum install epel-release
--> installation of the epel repository from the mandatory extras repo - this will make the proj package available

# yum install proj
--> installation of the proj library from epel repo

# yum install tinyxml
--> installation of the tinyxml library from epel repo

# yum install libzip
--> installation of the libzip library from mandatory base repo

--> the libaries tinyxml and libzip are required to run the Workbench, but it's installation rpm package doesn't inform on it and doesn't get them from the repos

# yum install mysql-workbench-community
--> finally the installation of the Workbench

Of course everything above can be done with much less typing since yum accepts the list of packages to be installed put in one line just only. I have made it so detail for better understanding.

In case of some other installation problems with this or anyone else package it is good idea to look at the yum log file:
cat /var/log/yum.log | tail -1

or at the log messages file:

cat /var/log/messages | tail -1

or again at the messages, but looking for any Workbench like lines only:

grep Workbench /var/log/messages


#Service Start

systemctl status mysqld.service
systemctl restart mysqld.service

#if above command fails
for i in `ps auxf|grep mysqld|grep "grep" -v|awk '{print $2}'`; do kill -9 $i; done

systemctl start mysqld.service
systemctl status mysqld.service

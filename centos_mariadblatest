Step #1: Add the MariaDB Repository

First, you’ll follow a simple best practice: ensuring the list of available packages is up to date before installing anything new:

yum -y update

Now find which repo you should use with the MariaDB repository generator. We’re going to add the CentOS 7 (64 bit) MariaDB 10.0 repository.

For a refresher on editing files with vim see: New User Tutorial: Overview of the Vim Text Editor

vim /etc/yum.repos.d/MariaDB10.repo

# MariaDB 10.0 CentOS repository list – created 2014-10-13 13:04 UTC
# http://mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/
[mariadb]
name = MariaDB
baseurl = http://yum.mariadb.org/10.0/centos7-amd64
gpgkey=https://yum.mariadb.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
gpgcheck=1

Then exit and save the file with the command :wq .
Step #2: Remove the Existing MariaDB Installation
Be sure to backup MariaDB and/or your entire server before proceeding with the following instructions!
Removing MariaDB will remove services that depend on MariaDB!

Stop MariaDB:


systemctl stop mariadb

Remove the existing MariaDB packages:


yum remove mariadb-server mariadb mariadb-libs

Clean-up the repository cache information with the following command:


yum clean all

Step #3: Install MariaDB 10.0

At this point, installing MariaDB 10.0 is as simple as running just one command:


yum -y install MariaDB-server MariaDB-client

And then start MariaDB again:


systemctl start mysql

Be sure that MariaDB is set to start at boot:


systemctl enable mysql

Run mysql_upgrade:


mysql_upgrade

Verify MySQL is now MariaDB by using the command client:


mysql

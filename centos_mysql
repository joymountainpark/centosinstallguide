mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'warren'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql>

Add a new user with database admin privs for a specific database, in this case the database is called “bugzilla”: (note: The ‘bugzilla’ database must first be added, see below.)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON bugzilla.* TO 'warren'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> 

Alternatively, you can give someone access to only certain privileges by substituting "ALL PRIVILEGES"
with any combination of the following (commas included):
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES

Add a MySQL database:
mysql> create database bugzilla;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.15 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> quit
